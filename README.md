# Comfy vi

Replace utils with plenary, vim, or just don't wrap uselessly

Merge too separated layers(like lsp)

Rename lsp layer to ide

Remove abz layer

Clauda-like layer: erik + database layer
Let them work together(context into db)
Reusable prompts

Telescope

Signatures for every function

Restruckture in some way, code reuse, groupping of finctionality, more dependencies will come with osint, scrape, exploitation

Create first tool so I can loot: 
wifi breaker or network mapper, 
add it to touch layer for single click launc


Wifi breaker: scan constantly and try to get into network. Store gps and network creds when success

Network mapper: check router speed then start scanning the subnet for devices, and then scan each famous ports of those devices
