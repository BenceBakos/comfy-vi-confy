 - recent command chooser
 - builder
 - teach from clipboard
 - store output as variable

 - implement:
     - control strucktures(iterate, conditional)
     - command
         - head(name)
         - arguments
     - variable(in file)
     - function(every program is a function after all)

A giant, always evolving singleton with easy to replace parts, like restarting nginx or mysql is kind of the same, right?
keeping it half lua and half abz 
if baseic structures are implemented, and then usable, then all should be possible

Implement:
 - function
 - condition
 - iteration
 - execution
 - variable
 - function call(but that reequires argument handling, and things like that, not very briht situation)
as well s conditions and iteration is reqireds argmemnts, so it has to be a more strickt singleton thingy.

maybe that idea of building from the same, configurable blocks is not so stupid after all

algorithm that can be configured, parts excluded, maybe some textual parts added, and appended to make up a program

I have to store commands, paths anyways

so this singleton + a maindmap of some sort?

configure this algorithm, append, app references from mindmap

start building on top of mindmap

what is this mindmap anyway? not a whole map, just associations between tokens, possibly making up a whole map


single interface from files,env vars  commands, and command envs(ssh, docker, cli)
This interface shall be scrollable, searchable.
nodes of this interface can be validated(which command, check path exists, etc)
possible interactions on the nodes of this curve, based on metadata, content
later, other interactions based on attributes is possible as well on other files

so:
veritcally displayed curve is the map

multitasking?

connection between nodes?

visualisation always sounds fun, but stupid in the end

I have local, and remote nodes, I can make remote nodes local

I can build on these nodes, I can reference them
