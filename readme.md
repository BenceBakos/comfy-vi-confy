## Touch

components are the wrong way of abstraction?(or just call them listeners, no single draw event should happen)

## store
 - left side:
     - click line: select lie
     - click separator: select section
 - right side:
     - in select mode: exet select mode
     - non-select mode: paste to canvas(open new canvas if something is selected)
 - search?

## canvas
 - left side:
     - click line: select lie
     - click separator: select section
 - right side:
     - in select mode: exet select mode
     - non-select mode: paste after clicked line(open new canvas if something is selected)
 - should be cut and paste instead of copy?
 - delete?
 - execute?
 - Don't forget desktop
 - Execute in terminal
 - Handle terminals on mobile
 - Search and exec can be blind
 - commands for work are very important! store in home directory, sinc with syncthing

## or just make my whole vim usable from my phone, and extremely usefull from desktop?
